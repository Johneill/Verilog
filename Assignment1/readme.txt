The purpose of this lab was to code a mini arithmetic logic unit using Verilog. 
Once the code was written and tested using the waveform generator on Vivado we 
then put the code on the board. But first we had to set up the inputs and outputs.
The switches were in the inputs and the LEDs were the outputs. 
The majority of this code was taken from previous Labs (Labs A- E). H
owever, some of the code from these labs needed to be altered as they were for 8 bits but this ALU was for 6 bits.
